# Travel List Project

This project is a simple React application designed to help users create and manage a list of items they need for travel. Users can add items with quantities, mark them as packed or unpacked, sort the list based on different criteria, and clear the list when needed.

## Features

- **Add Items**: Users can add items to their travel list along with the quantity required.
- **Mark as Packed/Unpacked**: Items can be marked as packed or unpacked with a checkbox. This helps users keep track of what they have already packed.
- **Sort Items**: Users can sort the list based on input order, description, packed status, or quantity. This provides flexibility in organizing the list according to the user's preference.
- **Clear List**: There is an option to clear the entire list, which can be useful when preparing for a new trip.
- **Statistics**: The application provides statistics on the number of items in the list and the percentage of items packed. This gives users an overview of their progress in preparing for the trip.

## How It Works

1. **Adding Items**: Users enter the item description and quantity in the form provided. Upon submission, the item is added to the list.
2. **Marking as Packed/Unpacked**: Each item in the list is accompanied by a checkbox. Clicking on the checkbox toggles the packed status of the item.
3. **Sorting Items**: Users can select different sorting criteria from the dropdown menu. The list is dynamically sorted based on the selected criterion.
4. **Clearing the List**: Clicking the "CLEAR LIST" button prompts the user for confirmation before clearing all items from the list.
5. **Statistics**: The statistics section calculates the total number of items in the list and the percentage of items that are packed. This information is displayed to the user, providing an overview of their progress.
